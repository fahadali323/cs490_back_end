  "description": "# Program Description In the early 2000â€™s people around the world used to watch any content which was delivered to them on their cable box. To watch video on demand you would had to tape tv shows or movies. You can then replay the Tape to consume the content. If you wanted to watch a movie, then you would have to go to the theatre. If the movie was no longer playing at the theatre, then you would have to buy or rent a tape or DVD from a rental store. You would have pay a small fee to rent any DVD for a few days. You would have a due date assigned, and if you go past the due date then it would be considered overdue. You would have to pay a penalty for each day it is delayed. Stores like blockbuster and Netflix were very a huge success in this business. Everyone still knows Netflix because they adapted to the changes in technology and changed their business model. Blockbuster on the other hand got acquired by some company and not many people know about them today. Sakila Database is a sample database provided by MySQL team. Its intended purpose was to be used as examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, and so forth. We are going to use this database as the starting point for our project. Sakila database provides tables necessary to run a DVD rental store. Your project is to bring this store onto the web. You will build a front end system that allows store clerks to manage their customers, inventory, and rentals. Back end system will connect to the Sakila MySQL database and provide endpoints that will serve the front end.",
